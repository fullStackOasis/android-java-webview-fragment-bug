# Android Java Mobile App with a WebView in a Fragment

This project can be used to debug problems when displaying a WebView in a Fragment.

Some websites just don't load in this demo.

Some load, but widgets like menu drawers do not display properly.

If you choose to load up https://amazon.com you will see a hamburger menu in the upper left corner. 
The hamburger menu does not function. 
When you click on it, the screen just goes blank.
